# TrafficSimulatorOpenGL

This project uses Visual Studio 2019 so download the repo and open the .sln file and it should (hopefully) work.

For some reason Visual Studio makes it kinda tricky to create new folders and uses filters instead that should show up when opened with visual studio so I
am not using any src or res files cos I am too lazy to make them.
